# HelloWorld

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

####

This application gathers data from an NestJs API I have created using angular and can be found at 

https://dogs-api-sx58.onrender.com/dogs

The backend repo can be found at 

https://github.com/patdunn01/dogs_BE

Please note, this has been made using a free tiered service on render.com so will take a moment or two to wake up before data can be retrieved from it. The "Fetching..." text will be shown in the application until the data is then rendered and displayed on the page.

I have also included some "nice to have" features which are not live just yet due to time contraints but the brief is otherwise fulfilled. These include the "Search" button on the home page and the "Find breeder" button on the breed page. 


Code has been commented at relevant points to outline how the application works.

I look forward to hearing your feedback!
